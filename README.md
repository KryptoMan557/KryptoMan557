- 👋 Hi, I’m @KryptoMan557 ... I am a rapper in the rap group JynxINC.  We are looking into expanding our brand outside the music medium into fictional literacy, 
- TV/Movie and video games.
- 👀 I’m interested in music, gaming and economics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, C++ and Unreal Engine 5
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a MMO/Survival RPG game that makes crypto mining more engaging and implements machine learning, low level AI and Macro data collection
